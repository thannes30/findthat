<h4>Resources:</h4>
<p>Google Developer Docs helped me get started on this project. I quickly learned that Google Maps API V3 is a very large and powerful API with endless capabilities.<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/"/></p>
<p>Foursquare is a great resource for location based searches, as they have a massive user submitted database of venues.<a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/"/></p>
